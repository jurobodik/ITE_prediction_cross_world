Welcome to the simulations for “Cross-World Assumptions and Their Role in Refining Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects”

If you’re here to reproduce the numerical experiments from the paper, you’re in the right place.

Step 1: Run `helpers.R`

This is the trickiest part. The script includes:

- A function `Jonkers_and_Alaa_wrappers_from_python()` that uses a Python virtual environment to run Python code from R.
  - You’ll need to manually set the path to your virtual environment.
  - That environment should include the codebase from `cct-cmc.zip`, which contains the implementations of Alaa et al. and Jonkers et al.
- A wrapper to load the IHDP dataset.
  - You’ll also need to set the path to where the `.csv` file is located.

I’m not a Python expert, so I can’t guarantee this will run the same on your machine. If you get stuck, feel free to reach out: juraj.bodik [at] unil.ch

Step 2: Run the simulations

If `helpers.R` runs correctly, you’re all set! The rest is easy:

- `sim_comparing.R` — runs simulations comparing different methods (both synthetic and IHDP)
- `sim_copulas.R` — explores how different copulas affect coverage

Good luck and have fun!
