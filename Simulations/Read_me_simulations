# Numerical Experiments for:  
**"Cross-World Assumptions and Their Role in Refining Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects"**

Hello and welcome!  
This repository contains the code for reproducing the simulations and numerical experiments from our paper:  
**_Cross-World Assumptions and Their Role in Refining Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects._**

If you're here to run the experiments â€” you're in the right place.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

Start by sourcing the file `helpers.R`.  
This is the trickiest part, as it includes a function `Jonkers_and_Alaa_wrappers_from_python()` that uses a Python virtual environment to run scripts from R.

To be fully transparent: I canâ€™t guarantee that it will run identically on your machine â€” I'm not primarily a Python person, so there might be quirks. That said, here's what you need to do:

- **Set up the virtual environment**: Point it to the `cct-cmc.zip` folder (or the extracted directory) which contains the implementations from Alaa et al. and Jonkers et al.
- **IHDP dataset**: The same file also includes a wrapper for uploading the IHDP dataset. You'll need to set the path to where the `.csv` file is located on your system.

If you manage to get `helpers.R` working, you're in great shape! If not, feel free to reach out:

## ðŸ“Š Simulations

Once `helpers.R` is sourced correctly, the rest is straightforward:

- `sim_comparing.R`: Simulations comparing various methods on both synthetic and IHDP datasets.
- `sim_copulas.R`: Simulations studying how different copulas influence interval coverage.

Good luck!
